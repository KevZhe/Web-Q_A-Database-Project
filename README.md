The objective of this project is to design a database and web-based user interface for a Q&A service similar to other services such as Stack Overflow or Yahoo Answers. In this system, users will be able to post questions, selecting a topic out of a multi-level hierarchy, post answers to other questions, and give likes to other user's answers. Users shall also be able to see a list of questions they have posted, answers they've provided, and new answers to their questions.
